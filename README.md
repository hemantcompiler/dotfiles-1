# dotfiles

This repo hosts my dotfiles. To install all of them, simply clone and run
`install.sh`

### Structure

Each directory is a *module*. Each module **must** have an `install.sh` and
(optionally) various configuration file. You can install a specific module by
running `module-name/install.sh`

### NeoVim

I've switched to neovim, but the nvim config file should work also with vim,
I've not tested it yet!
